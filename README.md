# NYCU-ML-Final-Project

This is my final project in the course, Introduction to Machine Learning in NYCU.

I retrieved the data about near earth objects from the open data of NASA with its API. Later, I tried to predict whether one of them is potentially hazardous.

If you're interested, you can see my source codes and report for more details.

## How the data generated?
1. Make a directory named `data/`.
2. Get an API key from the [NASA APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/).
3. Fill the key in `fetch.py` and run it.
4. Run `transform.py` and `neo.csv` is generated.
